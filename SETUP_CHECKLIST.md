## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "Missing Supabase environment variables"
**Fix**: Check your `.env` file exists and has correct variable names (`VITE_` prefix)

### ‚ùå "Cannot find module '@supabase/supabase-js'"
**Fix**: Run `npm install` again

### ‚ùå "Failed to fetch notes"
**Fix**: 
- Verify Supabase URL and key in `.env`
- Check table exists: `SELECT * FROM session_notes;` in SQL Editor
- Ensure RLS is disabled

### ‚ùå "Validation service unavailable"
**Fix**:
- Check Edge Function is deployed
- Verify function name is exactly `validate-session-note`
- Check function logs in Supabase for errors

### ‚ùå Port 3000 already in use
**Fix**: 
- Close other apps using port 3000
- Or change port in `vite.config.ts` to 3001

### ‚ùå TypeScript errors in IDE
**Fix**: 
- Run `npm install` first
- Restart your IDE/editor
- Close and reopen the project

## Verification Commands

### Check Node.js version
```bash
node --version
# Should be v18 or higher
```

### Check npm version
```bash
npm --version
# Should be 9+ or higher
```

### Check if dependencies are installed
```bash
ls node_modules/@supabase
# Should show supabase-js folder
```

### Check if .env file exists
```bash
cat .env
# Should display your environment variables
```

### Test Supabase connection
Open browser console on `http://localhost:3000` and run:
```javascript
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL);
// Should print your Supabase URL
```
